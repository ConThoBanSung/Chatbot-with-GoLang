## Introduction

This project uses the Go language to build a simple chatbot capable of answering questions from a provided dataset in CSV format. The chatbot model uses Cosine Similarity to compare the input question with questions in the dataset and find the closest match.

### Key Features:
- Read the dataset from a CSV file.
- Train the chatbot model.
- Save the trained model to a file.
- Test and answer user questions based on the trained model.
- Use Cosine Similarity to compute the similarity between the user's question and questions in the dataset.

## Requirements

To use this project, you need to install:
- Go version 1.18 or higher.
- A source code editor like VSCode, Sublime Text, or any other editor of your choice.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   First, clone the project to your local machine:
